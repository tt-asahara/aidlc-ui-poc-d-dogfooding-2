# Refined Mockups & UX Design

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Prior Context

- Read rough mockups from `<record>/ideation/rough-mockups/` (if exists)
- Read user stories from `<record>/inception/user-stories/`
- Read requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`

The classic scope skips rough-mockups by design (no Ideation phase); when the wireframes and user-flow inputs are absent, design the refined mockups directly from the user stories and requirements — never invent the content of a missing artifact.

### Step 2: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create `<record>/inception/refined-mockups/refined-mockups-questions.md` with questions:
- How should each user story be represented in the UI?
- What interaction patterns are needed (modals, inline edits, wizards, progressive disclosure)?
- What states must each screen handle (loading, empty, error, success, partial)?
- Does the design align with the existing design system / component library?
- What accessibility requirements apply (WCAG level)?
- What responsive breakpoints are needed?
- For APIs: what does the developer experience look like?

Follow stage-protocol.md question flow.

### Step 3: Collect and Analyze Answers

Validate design decisions against user stories and requirements for consistency.

### UI PoC evidence handoff

Run the C router with explicit `unresolved_visual_alternatives`. Apply historical Impeccable using the previously creator-confirmed context, approved requirements, and Stories/AC; use Matt UI only for a remaining explicit design question. Read all seven references and emit the WCAG correction report. Preserve core outputs and stable IDs, hash all assets and routing evidence, and do not claim approval; the ordinary AI-DLC gate is sole owner.

The plugin contract must have H2 sections Artifact References, Screen State Acceptance Mapping, Approval Evidence, and Testing Brief; exactly one fenced ui-poc-contract JSON object with schema=1, stage, arm A/B/C, assets [{path,sha256}], mappings [{screen,state,ac,asset,check}], and requiredMappings ["SCREEN-…/STATE-…/AC-…"]. Paths must remain inside this stage directory; hash every referenced local asset. For consuming code/test contracts include upstream {path,sha256,stage}, naming a byte-identical local copy of the prior contract, and require its real approval in the independently managed UI_POC_APPROVAL_LEDGER. Never fabricate that ledger. Rough/refined draft gates require no extra approval.

Read the installed runtime contract at .claude/tools/ui-poc/contract.md and the current arm’s .claude/tools/ui-poc/treatments/<arm>.json (lowercase a, b or c). Its source_lock resolves beside that JSON. Verify the selected commit and installed skill entrypoints before applying the treatment. These files are projected through the supported tools subtree; do not depend on uninstalled source docs or treatment directories.

### Step 4: Generate Artifacts

Create mid-to-high fidelity mockups (per user story/screen), interaction specification document (use `.claude/knowledge/aidlc-design-agent/component-spec-template.md` as the format for component-level specifications), design system mapping, responsive behavior specification, and accessibility compliance checklist.

For non-UI: create API developer experience specification.

### Step 5: Completion Handoff

Hand completion to `stage-protocol.md` via
`bun .claude/tools/aidlc.ts engine orchestrate report --stage refined-mockups --result <outcome>`.
That `report` call owns every lifecycle transition and advancement; never perform one in prose, and never narrate this bookkeeping to the user.

### Step 6: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :art:
Review path: `<record>/inception/refined-mockups/`
Standard approval gate (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under `<record>/inception/refined-mockups/`.

Imports: `required-sections`, `upstream-coverage`.

Upstream targets: `wireframes`, `user-flow`, `stories`, `requirements`, `team-practices`.

## Learn

When `directive.protocol_modules` lists `learnings`, follow
`stage-protocol-learnings.md`: keep the diary at `directive.memory_path` while
working and run the ritual before the approval gate, applying its bootstrap,
`single: true`, per-unit, and gate-revision exemptions. When the module is absent,
skip both the diary and the ritual.
